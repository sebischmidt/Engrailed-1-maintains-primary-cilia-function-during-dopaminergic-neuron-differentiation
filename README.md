# Engrailed 1 maintains primary cilia function during dopaminergic neuron differentiation

## Abstract
A key pathological feature of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (DAns) in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Considering the major role of EN1 in the development and maintenance of these DAns and the implications from En1 mouse models, it is highly interesting to study the molecular and protective effect of EN1. So far, all studies have been performed in mice, and reliable data of EN1 function in humans is still missing. Therefore, we generated EN1 knock-out (ko) human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSCs) lines and analyzed these during DAn differentiation. Although the EN1 ko didn’t interfere with DAn differentiation per se, these neurons have formed shorter processes. Furthermore, mitochondrial respiration, as well as mitochondrial complex I abundance was significantly reduced in fully differentiated neurons. To understand the implications of an EN1 ko during differentiation, we performed a transcriptome analysis of human neuronal precursor cells (hNPCs). This analysis revealed alterations in ciliogenesis and primary cilia maintenance which resulted in an elongation of primary cilia in EN1 deficient hNPCs. Besides, also Wnt signaling pathways were severely affected. Upon stimulating the EN1 ko hNPCs, EN1 expression was massively upregulated in WT lines, resulting in a further exacerbation of mitochondrial and ciliary phenotypes. Following Wnt stimulation, the EN1 ko hNPCs failed to enhance the expression of the complex I subunits NDUFS1 and 3, and now displayed a reduced mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, Wnt stimulation decreased ciliogenesis even further in EN1 ko hNPCs, but increased ciliary length. This further highlights the relevance of primary cilia next to mitochondria for the functionality and correct maintenance of human DAns and provides new possibilities to establish neuroprotective therapies for PD.
